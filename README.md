# MX_V2
Second generation KiCad Libraries of keyboard switch footprints  

<!-- ![Footprint Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid.pretty/master/Screenshots/Footprint.png)   -->
6 years after the creation of [the original MX_Alps_Hybrid library](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid), this library has been created as a successor and replacement.


## Features
* Designed from scratch using official datasheets and accurate measurements
* Almost every switch size in existence
* Topside soldermask to prevent solder overflow and improve appearance
* Various keysizes for all occasions
* Keysizes are generated via the script in 

## Included Libraries
* **MX_Solderable.pretty** - For Cherry MX type switches.
* **MX_Hotswap.pretty** - For Cherry MX type switches via hotswap sockets.
* **Alps_Solderable.pretty** - For alps SKCM/SKCL, SKBM/SKBL, and clones with same pin structure.  
* **MX_Alps_Hybrid.pretty** - Hybrid MX/Alps compatible solderable footprints.
* **Switch_LEDs.pretty** - LED footprints for keyswitches.
* Template.pretty - The template footprints that the script uses to generate footprints automatically. Do not use in production.

## Footprint Variants
* -ReversedStabilizers - Reversed stabilizer direction (north- vs south-facing)
* -Centered - Centered position LEDs. Use over regular types if needing center coordinates for each footprints (i.e. using PCBA).


## Contributing
Feel free to create pull requests with more footprints. I only ask that they are of high quality, are tested on real-world PCBs, and are based on official datasheets (if exists).
